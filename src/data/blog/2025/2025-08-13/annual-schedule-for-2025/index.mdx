## Previous Year Summary

In the full year of 2024, I learned `Nuxt`, `Tailwindcss`, `Typescript` etc for consolidate the frontend development skill and that's can help me to get a job in Japan as a frontend engineer, and also as a gap year I taken a lot of break to relaxing and treating me for my left life, I started to learn Japanese and accepted the JLPT N1 test, and planned to move to Japan as a IT engineer at second quarter of 2025, I thought is pretty hard to get and climb that especially in this probably oversaturated industry and in this great global recession that started at 2023, but I can not give it up just as I always do, I will do the best I can do and finally start my new life in Japan.

</Alert>

### Through the Probation Period

This is the most important thing and will be the most time spend in 2025, everything is volatile and uncertain because the probation period, and I can not change my career or the company rapidly, honestly I have no reason to change that but this period is definitely a unstable time, and there have so many things I need to adjust and consider, the probation duration is gonna be half of year, after that I can get my family to Japan, change my career or company freely, and update my visa to 3 years or 5 years (probably 3 years), so I do not need to worry about the visa period.

### Prepare for TOEIC Test

I have been learning English for 5 years above, so I do not wanna waste that skill, even I am already applying English so well for my job as a IT engineer, I still need to prepare for the TOEIC test, because that is the most common test for the English skill in Japan, and I need to get a score at latest 800 above so I can pin it in my resume.

Meanwhile, the 800+ score is not easy to get and this transcript will use for my future university application for a master degree, that is possibly will at 2026 or 2027 and further, so I will spend around half of year, at latest after I applied the updated visa for more longer stay period in Japan (probably will at 2026.6), because the transcript that the universities prefer is better in recent 2 years so I will accept the first test around at 2026.6 and use this transcript to apply part-time master course in a university in 2028 when I quitted the current job and transfer to other industry or current field but other company.

### JLPT N1 Test is Necessary

JLPT is one of the official language test for Japanese and identified by the Japanese government, the N1 is the highest level of this test that can help me barrier-less when I send my resume and apply for any job. It is a threshold or basic barrier for some positions and companies, and this test can help me to get more score when I apply the permanent resident identity in Japan, also this is one of the most easy path to get 15 points because in that `高度人材ポイント制度` list, get some point is seems pretty hard.

So, I can not give it up and will apply it again if I failed again in the first test at 2025.

### Prepare for `第二種電気工事士` Test

#### Why is It and Compare with Other Qualifications

`第二種電気工事士` is a national qualification in Japan that allows me to get a job as electrician.

Yep, there is has so many competitors to this qualification, such as `第三種配管技能士` and `自動車整備士`, which are also my preferences, and also in very severe labor shortage in Japan, but there has couple of disadvantages compare with `第二種電気工事士`:

- In position number, electrician is around 10 times more than the `第三種配管技能士`
- Even `自動車整備士`'s position is higher than `第二種電気工事士`, I will not choose it because
  - With the AI tide, the automatic driving is expect to perform in the forthcoming future probably 2030 in Japan, I do not think it is gonna be replace all of truck drivers but, at latest, In the highway and some route that have less traffic marks or signal lights and less population area, the almost truck drivers position probably will be replace by automatic driving technology.
  - And also with the tide of electric vehicles are being common, the `自動車整備士` position is not as stable as before because the electric vehicles are not ease to broke as the traditional fuel vehicles, and the maintenance is also not as complex as before.
  - At the end, the `自動車整備士` position is the `技能実習生` and `特定技能` visa holders covering position, so as a `人文知識・国際業務` visa holder, I do not need and without any reason to compete with them.
- The point is enough if I got a master degree in a Japanese university in the `高度人材ポイント制度` list, I do not need to get that more 5 points as `複数国家資格を持つ`.

#### When apply and When work as Electrician

There have no certain time to apply the test, but initial plan is before 2027, probably in the second test at 2026 because the probation period is gonna be end at 2026.3 and I have enough leisure and stable time to prepare that.

And also because I have TOEIC to spend the limited rest of leisure time, so that's it.

### Conclusion

In 2025, I will focus on through the probation period, and most important thing is to use the redundant time such as the recite English vocabularies in the committee time of morning and doing some practices of TOEIC testing around 30 mins in the lunch time probably 1 or 2 comprehension tests, and in the weekends, get some time to coding and watching the `第二種電気工事士` related videos.

Consolidate the frontend development skill such as learn a new framework like animation lib `motion`, UI lib `React` and cross-platform framework like `React Native` is also on the list but it seems not realistic because the time constraint.

After working full time, I decided to living comfortable and pay more attention to get happy and enjoy the life, so the promotion and career up plan is gonna be slow but not very slow, the margin is on **to progressing slowly but obviously**
