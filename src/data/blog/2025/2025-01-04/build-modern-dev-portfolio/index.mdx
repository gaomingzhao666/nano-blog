Nano Portfolio is a modern open-source portfolio template that is easy to use and customize, once config can automatically import your Github information. It is built with `Vue`, `Nuxt`, `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS` and `Github Octokit APIs`.

There is the [Github Repository](https://github.com/gaomingzhao666/nano-portfolio) and the [Demo Website](https://nano-portfolio-ruby.vercel.app/).

This tutorial will guide you through the process of building and deploying a modern portfolio using this open-source template.

## Prerequisites

<Alert>
  Before start, make sure you have:

  <ul>
    <li>basic knowledge about `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS/TS` </li>
    <li>a `Github` account</li>
    <li>installed `Node LTS v20` above on your machine</li>
    <li>installed versioning control tool `Git`</li>
  </ul>
</Alert>

## Clone the Template to Local

Firstly, you need to clone the template repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaomingzhao666/nano-portfolio.git
cd nano-portfolio
```

Secondly, install the dependencies that are required to run the project, by running one of the following commands depending on your package manager:

```bash
# if you are using pnpm as the package manager - recommend
pnpm install

# if you are using yarn as the package manager
yarn

# if you are using npm as the package manager - NodeJS default package manager
npm install
```

lastly, run the project locally by running the following command:

```bash
# pnpm - recommend
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn run dev

# npm - node default package manager
npm run dev
```

Once the project is successfully running, you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:xxxx`, the `xxxx` will be display automatically according to the port of the `Vite` version that project depends on.

And you will see the template looks like the screenshot below:

<Image
  src={indexImage}
  class="rounded-xl"
  alt={`img of the home page of nano-portfolio`}
/>

It means you have successfully cloned the template to your local machine and run it locally.

## Customize the Template

### Import Github Information

The template needs to work with your `Github Personal Access Token` to import your Github information. You can following the steps below to setting up your Token:

1. Generate a `Fine-grained Personal Access Token` by following the steps in [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
2. Copy the token and paste it into the `githubInfo.ts` file in the `/src/server/utils` folder
3. Restart the project

<Alert>
  Be notice that the token is sensitive information, please do not allow any
  write permission but keep it read-only when you generating the token.
</Alert>

If you have done the above steps correctly, you will see your repository information displayed on the home page, and your profile information displayed on the about page.

### Static Contents

You can customize any static contents of this template by modifying the files in `i18n/lang` folder. The template supports the [i18n](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Internationalization) (which means internationalization or localization) `English`, `Japanese` and `Chinese` by default. You can change any text in the files according to your needs.

Of course, you can also develop more functionalities or change anything you want by modifying the code in the project even if you just have basic knowledge about web development.

### SEO configuration

#### SEO for Website

The `@nuxtjs/seo` module is used to improve SEO performance in this project. You can configure it in the `nuxt.config.ts` file with some information about your site.

Here is an example of SEO configuration code in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
// see https://nuxtseo.com/
  site: {
    title: 'Nano Portfolio',
    url: 'https://nano-portfolio-ruby.vercel.app',
  },

  schemaOrg: {
    identity: 'Person',
  },

  seo: {
    meta: {
      description:
        'A modern and open-source developers portfolio template that can automatically import Github profile and repository information, made by Vue/Nuxt ecosystem and Octokit APIs',
      themeColor: [
        { content: '#111827', media: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)' },
        { content: 'white', media: '(prefers-color-scheme: light)' },
      ],

      colorScheme: 'dark light',
    },
  },

  robots: {
    // tell Google.com do not indexing /test and /error pages
    disallow: ['/test', '/error'],
  },
  ogImage: {
    enabled: false,
  },
```

See this [documentation](https://nuxtseo.com/docs/nuxt-seo/guides/using-the-modules) if you want to see a complete guide.

#### SEO for Each Pages

Everything is out of box, you can configure the SEO metadata for each pages from the `/src/i18n/seo/` folder, and modify depends on your demand.

### Block the Repositories You Don't Want to Show

If you have some repositories that you don't want to show on the home page, you can block them by adding the topics name to the `getClearedRepo` function in the `info.get.ts` file in the `/server/api/repo` folder, which means the repositories that have those topics you added will not be displayed on home page.

For example, if you want to block the repositories that have the `config` or `backup` topics, you can modify the function like this:

```ts
// repos that have config or backup topics will not be displayed
const getClearedRepo = (repoInfo: any) => {
  return repoInfo.data.filter(
    (data: any) =>
      !(data.topics.includes('config') || data.topics.includes('backup')),
  )
}
```

## Deploy the Project

After you have done all of stuffs you needs, you can deploy the project to the cloud platform, which is the most popular solution especially for frontend developer. The major platform have `Vercel`, `Netlify`, `Github Pages` etc.

The [nano-portfolio demo](https://nano-portfolio-ruby.vercel.app/) is deployed on `Vercel`, you can deploy your project to `Vercel` by referring to the detailed [Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deployment-methods), we recommend you to use the `Vercel for Git` solution, which is the easiest way to deploy a project if you have a Github account and already pushed the project to the github repository.

There is some sample steps to deploy the project to `Vercel` by using `Vercel for Git`:

1. Login to `Vercel` by using your Github account
2. Click the `Start Deploying` button on [Vercel Home](https://vercel.com/home) page
3. Select the repository you want to deploy and click `Import` button
4. Settings will be automatically set, but you can still configure the settings according to your needs
5. Click the `Deploy` button
6. Wait for the building to complete, and you will see the deployment URL
7. Open the URL in your browser, everything is done!

<Alert>
  Be notice that the nano-portfolio have a comment system that build by mongodb
  have not configured yet.
</Alert>

If you also want to the comment system work properly, you need to add [Mongodb Atlas](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas) integration to the project you just deployed successfully by referring to the [integration documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/how-to-connect-mongodb-atlas-to-vercel-using-the-new-integration/)
